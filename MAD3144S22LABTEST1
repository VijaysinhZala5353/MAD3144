	<tr>
		<p>Dogs were the first animal domesticated (tamed) by humans, over 20,000 years ago! <br>
		 As they evolved from wolves, their skulls, teeth and paws shrank, and they became <br>
		more docile and obedient. FUN FACT! Evidence from fossils suggests that five types of <br>
		dog had evolved by the Bronze Age, around 4500BC</p>

		<h1>Fox</h1>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<p>Fox features typically include a triangular face, pointed ears, an elongated rostrum,<br>
		 and a bushy tail. They are digitigrade (meaning they walk on their toes). Unlike most <br>
		members of the family Canidae, foxes have partially retractable claws. Fox vibrissae,<br>
		or whiskers, are black.</p>

		<h1>Tiger</h1>

		<p>The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest living cat species and a member of the <br>
		genus Panthera. It is most recognisable for its dark vertical stripes on orange fur with<br>
		a white underside. An apex predator, it primarily preys on ungulates, such as deer and wild boar.</p>
